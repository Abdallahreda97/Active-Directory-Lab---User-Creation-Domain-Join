# Active Directory Lab - User Creation & Domain Join

In this lab, I set up a simple Active Directory environment using Windows Server as a Domain Controller.

I created multiple users and added them to a custom group.  
Then, I connected a Windows 10 virtual machine to the domain and logged in using the user account `abdallah.elmohr`.
